Adaptive  filtering  techniques  are  used  in  a  widevariety  of  applications,  owing  to  the  tremendous  developmentin  technology  that  has  led  to  noisy  vehicles,  heavy  equipment,high-speed  wind  buffeting  and  other  noise  sources.  Noise  issuesin  the  ecosystem  have  attracted  interest.  The  question  of  overthe  years,  regulating  the  level  of  noise  has  been  the  subjectof  a  significant  amount  of  study.  Various  adaptive  algorithmsfor  noise  cancellation  have  been  developed  over  the  last  fewyears. The implementation of LMS (Least Mean Square), NLMS(Normalized  Least  Mean  Square)  and  RLS  (Recursive  LeastSquare)  algorithms  on  the  MATLAB  platform  is  introducedin   this   paper   in   order   to   evaluate   their   noise   cancellationefficiency.  We  simulate  the  adaptive  filter  with  a  noisy  tonesignal  and  a  white  noise  and  white  noise  signal;  analyse  thealgorithm outputs in terms of MSE (Mean Squared Error), noisereduction  percentage,  computational  complexity,  and  stability.The  findings  indicate  that  RLS  is  the  most  efficient  yet  cost-effective  computational  complexity  and  memory  requirement.
